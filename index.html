  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Nikita Kravtsov. I'm a second-year student at the Belarusian-Russian University.
    My specialization is software engineering. At this moment, I'm looking for job opportunities
    and I'm open to any offers and projects. My main goal is to take part in many interesting projects,
    meet new people with the same interests, and learn new things about the IT sphere. My best character
    traits are responsibility and patience, determination and creativity, which in my point of view are
    the most important in IT.
